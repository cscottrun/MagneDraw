keep array of coordinates that have been touched, until state is cleared. 

instead of keeping track of coordinate points, I only need to know the difference from the starting position

colors:
  purple: #7E5BFF
  dark purlpleblue: #4B66E8
  light blue: #5FB7FF
  lighter blue: #4BDDE8
  seafoam: #52FFC6
