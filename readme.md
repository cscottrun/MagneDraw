# MagneDraw

MagneDraw is a mobile app used to create technical and non-technical drawings using a magnet. Instead of taking a photo of your whiteboard drawing, simply draw with a magnetic marker and see your creation digitized in real time.

Using the built-in magnetic sensors of your smart-phone, MagneDraw picks up on your magnetic marker and renders your drawing accordingly. Once your drawing is complete, cast it to your favorite website, friend, or google drive.
